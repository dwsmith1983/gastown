		Description: `Single step to rebuild and install the gt binary after code changes.

## Step: install
Build and install the gt binary locally.

Run from the rig directory:
` + "```" + `
go build -o gt ./cmd/gt
go install ./cmd/gt
` + "```" + `

Verify the installed binary is updated:
` + "```" + `
which gt
gt --version  # if version command exists
` + "```",

// BootstrapGasTownMolecule returns the bootstrap molecule for new Gas Town installations.

func BootstrapGasTownMolecule() BuiltinMolecule {
	return BuiltinMolecule{
		ID:    "mol-bootstrap",
		Title: "Bootstrap Gas Town",
		Description: `Complete setup of a new Gas Town installation.

Run this after installing gt and bd via Homebrew. This molecule guides you through
creating an HQ, setting up rigs, and configuring your environment.

## Step: locate-hq
Determine where to install the Gas Town HQ.

Ask the user for their preferred location. Common choices:
- ~/gt (recommended - short, easy to type)
- ~/gastown
- ~/workspace/gt

Validate the path:
- Must not already exist (or be empty)
- Parent directory must be writable
- Avoid paths with spaces

Store the chosen path for subsequent steps.

## Step: create-hq
Create the HQ directory structure.

` + "```" + `bash
mkdir -p {{hq_path}}
cd {{hq_path}}
gt install . --name {{hq_name}}
` + "```" + `

If the user wants to track the HQ in git:
` + "```" + `bash
gt git-init --github={{github_repo}} --private
` + "```" + `

The HQ now has:
- mayor/ directory
- .beads/ for town-level tracking
- CLAUDE.md for mayor context

Needs: locate-hq

## Step: setup-rigs
Configure which rigs to add to the HQ.

Default rigs for Gas Town development:
- gastown (git@github.com:steveyegge/gastown.git)
- beads (git@github.com:steveyegge/beads.git)

For each rig, run:
` + "```" + `bash
gt rig add <name> <git-url> --prefix <prefix>
` + "```" + `

This creates the full rig structure:
- refinery/rig/ (canonical main clone)
- mayor/rig/ (mayor's working clone)
- crew/main/ (default human workspace)
- witness/ (polecat monitor)
- polecats/ (worker directory)

Needs: create-hq

## Step: build-gt
Build the gt binary from source.

` + "```" + `bash
cd {{hq_path}}/gastown/mayor/rig
go build -o gt ./cmd/gt
` + "```" + `

Verify the build succeeded:
` + "```" + `bash
./gt version
` + "```" + `

Needs: setup-rigs
Tier: haiku

## Step: install-paths
Install gt to a location in PATH.

Check if ~/bin or ~/.local/bin is in PATH:
` + "```" + `bash
echo $PATH | tr ':' '\n' | grep -E '(~/bin|~/.local/bin|/home/.*/bin)'
` + "```" + `

Copy the binary:
` + "```" + `bash
mkdir -p ~/bin
cp {{hq_path}}/gastown/mayor/rig/gt ~/bin/gt
` + "```" + `

If ~/bin is not in PATH, add to shell config:
` + "```" + `bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
# or ~/.bashrc for bash users
` + "```" + `

Verify:
` + "```" + `bash
which gt
gt version
` + "```" + `

Needs: build-gt
Tier: haiku

## Step: init-beads
Initialize beads databases in all clones.

For each rig's mayor clone:
` + "```" + `bash
cd {{hq_path}}/<rig>/mayor/rig
bd init --prefix <rig-prefix>
` + "```" + `

For the town-level beads:
` + "```" + `bash
cd {{hq_path}}
bd init --prefix hq
` + "```" + `

Configure sync-branch for multi-clone setups:
` + "```" + `bash
echo "sync-branch: beads-sync" >> .beads/config.yaml
` + "```" + `

Needs: setup-rigs
Tier: haiku

## Step: sync-beads
Sync beads from remotes and fix any issues.

For each initialized beads database:
` + "```" + `bash
bd sync
bd doctor --fix
` + "```" + `

This imports existing issues from JSONL and sets up git hooks.

Needs: init-beads
Tier: haiku

## Step: verify
Verify the installation is complete and working.

Run health checks:
` + "```" + `bash
gt status          # Should show rigs with crew/refinery/mayor
gt doctor          # Check for issues
bd list            # Should show issues from synced beads
` + "```" + `

Test spawning capability (dry run):
` + "```" + `bash
gt spawn --help
` + "```" + `

Print summary:
- HQ location
- Installed rigs
- gt version
- bd version

` + "```" + `bash
git fetch origin main
git rebase origin/main
` + "```" + `

If there are conflicts, resolve them carefully and
continue the rebase.
Needs: self-review, verify-tests

## Step: submit-merge
Submit to merge queue. Create PR if needed.
Verify CI passes.

File any remaining work as issues.

Document any important context for the next session
or for anyone reviewing the work.
Needs: submit-merge

## Step: request-shutdown

		Description: `Release checklist for Gas Town version {{version}}.

This molecule ensures all release steps are completed properly.
Replace {{version}} with the target version (e.g., 0.1.0).

## Step: update-version
Update version string in internal/cmd/version.go.

Change the Version variable to the new version:
` + "```" + `go
var (
    Version   = "{{version}}"
    BuildTime = "unknown"
    GitCommit = "unknown"
)
` + "```" + `

## Step: rebuild-binary
